EJS TEMPLATES ARE PROCESSED THROUGH EJS VIEW ENGINE ON SERVER
EJS->EJS VIEW ENGINE->HTML (SERVER SIDE RENDERING)


We need a place to create our views.
// By default express and ejs will check in views folder (default value)
// if you want another one
// use:app.set('views','myviews')
// just .ejs as extension
//
// Also use RENDER instead of sendfile like   :render('index')



PASSING DATA INTO VIEWS
TAGS ARE Like :<%  %>
ex:<p><%= name %></p>   //= is used as it is only one to be outputted 
ex:
also can send parameter(is just a object) in render method 
res.render('index',{title:'Home'})
// this object is passed into index.ejs file 
and we can access it as :
<title>NET NINJA    <%= title%>     </title>
YOU CAN PASS ANYTHING LIKE : A OBJECT  //CHECK IN app.js file

WORKING WITH EJS:
1...<% if(blogs.length > 0){%>
2...<% } %>
3...<p class="title">  <%=blogs.snippet %>   </p>
4...<%  } else { %>



//PARTIALS :-

parts of template which could be reused in different views
//check partials folder
used as :
<%- include('relativepath')%>
here we have used - sign as = sign escapes special character and we end up with string value
