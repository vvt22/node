MIDDLEWARE:-
Any kind of Code or Functons which runs(on the server) between 
getting a request and sending a response.
The use method is generally used to run some middleware code.
we can have more than one piece of middleware
even a GET handler is middleware 
THE ORDER OF MIDDLEWARE IS VERY IMP AS IT RESPONSES BACK 

MIDDLEWARE EXAMPLES:-
LOGGER MIDDLEWARETO LOG DETAILS OF EVERY REQUEST
AUTHENTICATION CHECK MIDDLEWARE FOR PROTECTED ROUTER
MIDDLEWARE TO PARSE JSON DATA FROM REQUESTS
RETURN 404 PAGES

morgan:
npm install morgan
and in code:
const morgan=require('morgan')


Even we cant access CSS styles as the server protects our file automatically
So we have to specify what file should be given access .
there is a readymade middleware (static middleware)
as: app.use(express.static('folder'))
